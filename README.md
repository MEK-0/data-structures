# Data Structures in C/C++

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures using **C** and **C++**. It is designed for students and developers to practice and better understand how data structures work at a low level.

## 📚 Contents

The repository includes the following data structure implementations:

- **Singly Linked List**
  - Creating a linked list
  - Adding and displaying structures
- **Doubly Linked List**
  - Node deletion operations
- **Circular Linked List**
  - Adding and reading elements
- **Stack**
  - Stack creation and basic functions
- **Binary Tree**
  - Binary tree structure and traversal
- **Time Analysis**
  - Simple algorithm performance analysis
- **C++ Sample**
  - C++ implementation of basic structures
